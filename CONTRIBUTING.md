## 1. Issue Creation

Before starting work, please create an issue describing:

- **Problem/Enhancement**: Clear description of the issue or proposed feature  
- **Clinical Relevance**: How it impacts clinical utility or research validity  
- **Technical Approach**: Proposed solution methodology  
- **Expected Outcomes**: Measurable success criteria  

## 2. Development Guidelines

### Code Quality Standards

- **Documentation**: All functions must have docstrings explaining clinical context  
- **Testing**: Include unit tests for new functionality  
- **Reproducibility**: Ensure deterministic results with random seeds  
- **Performance**: Maintain or improve computational efficiency  

### Clinical Research Standards

- **Data Leakage Prevention**: Rigorously check for information leakage  
- **Validation Methodology**: Follow established clinical validation protocols  
- **Ethical Compliance**: Ensure all work meets IRB/ethics requirements  
- **Statistical Rigor**: Use appropriate statistical tests and corrections  

### Code Style Examples
```python
# Use descriptive variable names with clinical context
sbp_measurements = extract_systolic_bp_data(patient_ids)
dbp_predictions = model.predict_diastolic_bp(features)

# Include clinical interpretations in comments
# Heart rate variability indicates autonomic function
# which correlates with cardiovascular stability
hr_variability = calculate_hrv_features(hr_timeseries)
```
